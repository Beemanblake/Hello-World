# Hello-World
My first repository! Hello coding community!
My name is Blake and I feel I have a lot of talent to share with the community.
I'm currently seeking a degree and career in coding.
I raise and collect honey from honey bees.
I'm excited to finally be on GitHub!
I love to learn new things, coding, cooking, target shooting, and gardening.
I love sushi and pretty much all non-fermented asian food. I like soy sauce, hoisin sauce and fish sauce though which are fermented.
I only have a crappy little laptop. no consoles or merc monster builds.
Skittles are my favorite candy besides any real chocolate, no Palmer's bs.
I have exactly a dozen guns which i clean and shoot skillfully.
Semantics is actually fun for me, though not so much discussing them.
Math is what makes me comfortable.
Working with my hands and creating things is what makes life special.
