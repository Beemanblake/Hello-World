# Hello-World
My first repository! Hello coding community!
My name is Blake and I feel I have a lot of talent to share with the community.
I'm currently seeking a degree and career in coding.
I raise and collect honey from honey bees.
I'm excited to finally be on GitHub!
I love to learn new things, coding, cooking, target shooting, and gardening.
